### by Alex Merced (AlexMercedCoder.com)

## Welcome

Welcome!!! If you are reading this you are about to embark on a Software Engineering Immersive Remote course. I've created this markdown to highlight some best practices to best prepare before your first day of class and as a reference throughout the cohort for useful resources.

### Please Start by Watching the Video Below

## Bash (Terminal)

Bash is the default shell environment in unix based systems (Mac and Linux). Windows is not unix based which is the primary reason we heavily discourage going through the course with a windows environment although are several options on how to use your windows machine in the course.

1. Install Xubuntu (https://xubuntu.org/) as a second operating on your machine (This is in my opinion the best option and a tutorial how to do so is here: https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-installing-xubuntu-linux-2202075)

2. Use Windows Subsystem for Linux to have a Linux environment in your windows install (here is a tutorial => https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10 keep in mind any WSL specific issues will be on you to troubleshoot throughout the course)

3. Install Xubuntu into a virtual machine using VirtualBox (tutorial: https://lmtools.com/setup-ubuntu-virtual-machine-in-windows-using-oracle-virtualbox warning this can slow depending on the resources you share with the virtual machine)

4. Just use windows but install git-bash to have access to a bash shell in your windows file system, it's not exactly the same and will have minor differences along the way. I'll add a section later with tips if you decide not to go with option 1 which I HIGHLY recommend as the best option. (https://gitforwindows.org/)

You will be spending a lot of time in the course in the bash shell so getting familiar with how it works will make life much easier.
