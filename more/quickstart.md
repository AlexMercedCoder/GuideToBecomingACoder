**NOTICE FOR WINDOWS USERS**

<p>

Bash is the default shell environment in unix based systems (Mac and Linux). Windows is not unix based which is the primary reason we heavily discourage going through the course with a windows environment although there are several options on how to use your windows machine in the course.

1. Install Xubuntu (https://xubuntu.org/) as a second operating on your machine (This is in my opinion the best option and a tutorial how to do so is here: https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-installing-xubuntu-linux-2202075)

2. Use Windows Subsystem for Linux to have a Linux environment in your windows install (here is a tutorial => https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10 keep in mind any WSL specific issues will be on you to troubleshoot throughout the course)

3. Install Xubuntu into a virtual machine using VirtualBox (tutorial: https://lmtools.com/setup-ubuntu-virtual-machine-in-windows-using-oracle-virtualbox warning this can slow depending on the resources you share with the virtual machine)

4. Just use windows but install git-bash to have access to a bash shell in your windows file system, it's not exactly the same and will have minor differences along the way. I'll add a section later with tips if you decide not to go with option 1 which I HIGHLY recommend as the best option. (https://gitforwindows.org/)

## Step 1 - Account Openings

You'll want free accounts to all the following services to use throughout the cohort. Make sure you track the username and passwords somewhere.

- Github.com
- Git.GeneralAssemb.ly
- Netlify.com
- Vercel.com
- Codepen.com
- Repl.it
- CodeSandbox.io
- Heroku.com
- MongoDB.com
- Zoom (also make sure to have software installed)
- Slack (Should have been invited to GA Students Workspace after Enrollment)


## 2 - Setting Up Git Locally

[GIT CONFIG DOCUMENTATION](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

Using the above link you want to configure your identity on your local git install. The name and in particularly the email should match the same email you used to signup for github.com and git.generalassemb.ly.

[Adding an SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.20/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

Follow the directions above for your operating system to add an SSH key to your github.com account, also add the same SSH key to you git.generalassemb.ly account. This is not required but the benefit is you won't have to type your credentials to login all the time cause the SSH key acts as a fingerprint for your computer.

*You Can Also Watch the Video I posted in the main [readme.md](./readme.me) in this repo on SSH keys for a visual guide on how to do this*

## Step 3 - Downloading VSCode

- Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download and install the visual studio code software, watch the videos on the main [readme.md](./readme.me) to learn the basics on how to use it and useful extensions that will help make your life easier.

## Step 4 - Downloading NodeJS

- Headover to NodeJS.org and download and install it. Learn about what is NodeJS and how to use it with the video in the main [readme.md](./readme.me).

## Step 5 - Learn the tools

Head back to the main [readme.md](./readme.me) and read the basics on each tool so you have a starting idea on what the role of each tool is. We'll be explaining them during class but having a primer will help you get comfortable with them quicker.
