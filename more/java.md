# Java

Java is one of the older and most popular programming languages. Java code is compiled to run in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which can be run in any operating system thus the phrase "write once, run anywhere" was born. Java is still super popular, but other languages have since been created to run in the JVM including Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, Haxe, and Scala.
