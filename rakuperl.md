# Raku and Perl5/7

Perl is one of the older languages that has been used to build backend web applications. When Perl 6 was released it was so radically different it split the Perl community into two. Those who preferred Perl 6 decided to rename it into a new language called Raku while those who preferred Perl 5 with the more classic Perl syntax are still using Perl 5 and the next big update will be Perl 7. Perl and Raku are both very flexible languages that give developers plethora on syntactical tools to write concise code.
